As the developers of this app, we wanted to create the best task manager app on the market, covering all essential features, and more!\
The basics of the app include adding, editing, and deleting a task - create and add descriptions, deadlines, tags, and priorities for your todo items!\
Completed a certain task? Good job! Mark tasks as "completed" and have them accessible in the "Completed" tasks section.\
Deleted a task but changed your mind? No worries - head to the trash folder to restore a previously deleted item!
